# This Repository is an example. 

It serves as an educational exmaple of usage of [Twig](https://twig.symfony.com/) in a framework agnostic context to show other developers that you do not need to be using Symfony to use Twig. Meaning you can use it with just pure PHP or within other frameworks such as CodeIgniter with some boilerplate written out.
